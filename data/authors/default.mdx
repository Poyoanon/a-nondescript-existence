I'm a huge bozo. I'm better known to my friends as Pozo.

For now, I am just a hobbyist enjoying frontend development and making pretty websites and living life. Eventually I'd love to formalise my experience and work as a proper software developer in the near future.

I play Lost Ark a lot on the Una server, and I main Reaper. Maybe you'll see me on NAE hanging about, or on the Discord.

Oh, and I enjoy orcas. And dinosaurs.
