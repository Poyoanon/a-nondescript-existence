# The First of Many
A blog's a blog, and I don't purport to be a *good* writer by any means. I tend to go quite a bit off tangent a lot and focused writing was something I never really bothered doing for a really long time. Hopefully these ramblings mean something to someone, and even if that weren't the case, it still means something to me.

Setting up this blog has been quite a bit of a challenge and I intend to completely personalize this blog and how it looks soon. It's going to be somewhat difficult to visualize what I'd like it to be, but I want it to be a collection of my personal thoughts, projects, and the like. Hell, I'd be down to do book reviews in this blog. We'll see.
